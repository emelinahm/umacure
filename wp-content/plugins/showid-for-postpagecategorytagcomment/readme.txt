== Description ==

This plugin shows post/page/category/tag/comment/media/user IDs on admin's edit post/page/category/tag/comment/media/user pages. You can see the ID when you visit an edit post/page/category/tag/comment/media/user page. This plugin requires WP2.9 or later.

Since this plugin hooks on 'edit' link, only users with priviledges can see IDs. For example, a user of author role can see post IDs, while a user of subscriber role cannot.
