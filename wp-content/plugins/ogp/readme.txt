Adds Open Graph tags to your blog. Control how your posts and pages are presented on Facebook and other social media sites. No configuration needed.

== Description ==

Automagically adds Open Graph tags to your blog. Control how your posts and pages are presented on Facebook and other social media sites. No configuration needed.

When someone likes or shares your blog on Facebook, your header image is shown. If someone likes or shares a post, the featured image (post thumbnail) is shown. If you haven't selected a featured image, then the plugin looks for the first image inside the post. If there aren't any images in your post, then your blog's header image is shown.
